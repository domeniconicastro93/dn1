PHASE 5 – ORCHESTRATOR & STREAMING

GOALS:
- Implement full GPU VM lifecycle:
    • TEMPLATE
    • PROVISIONING
    • BOOTING
    • READY
    • IN_USE
    • DRAINING
    • ERROR
    • TERMINATED
- Implement CreateVM, AssignSession, MarkReady, MarkDraining, HandleError.
- Implement region fallback.
- Implement GPU templates (L4-360, A10, A16, 4080, etc.).
- Implement per-game streaming presets.
- Implement WebRTC ingest + signaling + control channel.
- Integrate with session-service.

RULES:
- Keep logs and metrics.
- Do NOT start replay buffer yet (next phase).
- Use events (Kafka/NATS) exactly as defined.

STOP when:
- A real VM/session can start and stream video to Web/Mobile stub player
