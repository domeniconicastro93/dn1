PHASE 1 – FIGMA & REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

GOALS:
- Parse the Figma prototype (web + mobile) provided by me.
- Extract all pages, components, overlays, routes, user flows.
- Map each Figma screen to:
  • a route
  • a component
  • backend calls required
  • state requirements
  • error and edge cases
- Build the ROUTING BLUEPRINT for Web and Mobile.
- Build the COMPONENT BLUEPRINT (UI elements).
- Build the DATAFLOW BLUEPRINT (API calls and events).
- Identify all missing information with TODO comments.

RULES:
- Do NOT write code yet.
- Only output structured markdown.
- Keep consistency with the Master Prompt.

STOP when:
- Blueprints are produced.
- No coding has started.
