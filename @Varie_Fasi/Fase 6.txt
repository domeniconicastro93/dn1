PHASE 6 – REPLAY ENGINE (90–120s BUFFER)

GOALS:
- Implement 120s circular RAM buffer (FFmpeg/GStreamer).
- Duplicate encoded stream: one to client, one to buffer.
- Implement SaveReplay(sessionId).
- Implement NVENC settings exactly:
    • preset P1 / low-latency-high-quality
    • CBR 8–15 Mbps
    • GOP = 120
    • low latency VBV
- Upload MP4 to storage.
- Emit ReplayCreated event.

RULES:
- Zero disk I/O in hot path.
- Use high-performance pipeline.

STOP when:
- SaveReplay works and clip uploads correctly
